## General info

The objective of this Codecademy portfolio project is to build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub.

I decided to combine my love of literature, in this case Shakespeare, with this project. I have chosen 3 different sonnets (i.e., Sonnets 127, 75, 65, 3, 55) and divided each into (1) **sonnet title**, (2) **the octave**, or first 8 lines of each sonnet, and (3) **the sestet**, the last 6 lines of each sonnet. A mixed or "shooken up" sonnet will be randomly returned to the user.

## Technologies

Technologies used in the creation of this project:

- Javascript ES6
- CLI
- Git and Github (and commiting/pushing using VS Code)

## Setup

To run this project: download the mixed-messages directory locally, access the mixed-messages directory in the terminal, and run node script.js multiple times to recieve jumbled sonnets.

```
$ cd ../mixed-messages
$ node script.js
```
